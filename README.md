**Calculator Project**

This is a simple and interactive Calculator application built using only HTML and CSS. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with a clean and intuitive interface.

📝 What Does It Do?

The Calculator project provides a minimal interface for simple calculations:

Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide: Perform basic arithmetic operations.

Clear: Reset the input and result display.

Instant Feedback: The UI shows button presses and input in real-time.

⚙️ How Does It Work?

The project is built purely with HTML and CSS:

HTML Structure: Defines the calculator layout, buttons, and display.

CSS Styling: Uses styling to create a visually appealing layout, button effects, and responsive design.

Button Interaction: CSS pseudo-classes like :active provide visual feedback on clicks.

🎓 What Have I Learned?

By building this project, I improved my understanding of:

HTML Layouts: Structuring elements semantically for a functional UI.

CSS Styling: Designing interactive buttons, flex/grid layouts, and responsive interfaces.

UI/UX Principles: Creating a user-friendly calculator without JavaScript.

Creative Problem Solving: Implementing interactive-like behavior using only CSS.
